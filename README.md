# SDO-Check

SDO-Check is a web-tool that enables the fast and simple verification of schema.org annotations. It is the open-source version of the SDO-Check tool of semantify.it (http://sdocheck.semantify.it/). This tool allows the input of a code-snippet or a web-page URL and shows the verification result in form of an interactive tree-visualization with details about all irregularities found.  The verification is based on the latest version of the official schema.org vocabulary, common SEO practices, and recommendations from semantic web experts.
